# SRC-Client
Hello all, this is a 'client' I made in Python for Speedrun.com.
Its not much of a client right now, download the source code in the main branch and run it in your terminal, or ide if you run things in your IDE terminal (use thonny if you wanna run it cuz you just hit F5, see https:/thonny.org for more info).
Enjoy the client :).

__Features__

Right now you can search games, see the records, levels and categories in that game and see the links for the record runs per game.
Every other feature is under development.
Next feature to be added will probably be either series search or, more likely, runs awaiting verification and pending runs.
